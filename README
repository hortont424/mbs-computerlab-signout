==== mbs-computerlab-signout ====

 === Introduction ===

	The MBS computer lab currently uses a somewhat hackish paper signout system,
	which leads to significant problems when trying to access archives, retrieve
	statistics, and share data.
	
	This application provides a web-based interface for a single-head signout
	system, which will run on a machine in place of the paper binder currently
	used. It strives to be as simple to understand as possible while providing
	an improved feature set over the "old" solution.

 === Caveats ===

	* No locking: there is no locking mechanism in place, so if multiple users
	              attempt to update the database in tandem, they can easily
	              generate conflicts; this was designed to be accessed from a
	              single machine, kiosk-style
	* No password: there is no password protection during the signout process;
	               this isn't a problem with the single-head design, but there 
	               is a semi-complete implementation of protection a few Git
	               revisions back
	* No admin panel: there is currently no administration panel, so updating
	                  the list of teachers is still a difficult prospect, which
	                  involves editing a few source files and manually inserting
	                  fields into the database

 === TODO ===

	* Admin panel: update resource counts and teacher lists
	* "Other": show comment as name for "Other" teacher
	* Design: make buttons (arrows and large buttons) look more like buttons

 === Dependencies ===

	* Python >= 2.6
	* CherryPy HEAD (>= r2279)
	* SQLite3
